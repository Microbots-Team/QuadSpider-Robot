## 📅 Project Timeline & Context

- **Event:** FMEE 2025 – **AI & Robotics Club** Open Day
- **Date:** November 10–11–12, 2025

## 💡 Project Overview
**QuadSpider** is a compact four-legged robotic creature designed to explore app-based motion control.  
Using eight servos, an ESP32, and a mobile app, the robot can:

- Walk forward or backward  
- Turn left or right  
- Execute preset movement sequences

 
Each of its four legs uses a dual-servo configuration, giving the robot the agility to walk, turn, and even perform predefined movement sequences—small choreographies triggered at the tap of a button.


The goal is to blend lightweight hardware with wireless mobile control, creating an accessible platform for learning robotics, gait generation, and ESP32 IoT communication.
